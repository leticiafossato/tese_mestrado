       " '    <S sid=\"13\" ssid=\"2\">The former stem from the work of Halliday and Hasan (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"14\" ssid=\"3\">They proposed that text segments with similar vocabulary are likely to be part of a coherent topic segment.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"15\" ssid=\"4\">Implementations of this idea use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al., 1999), entity repetition (Kan et al., 1998), semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), word distance model (Beeferman et al., 1997a) and word frequency model (Reynar, 1999) to detect cohesion.</S>\\n',\n",

       " '    <S sid=\"17\" ssid=\"6\">Lexical cohesion methods are typically used for segmenting written text in a collection to improve information retrieval (Hearst, 1994; Reynar, 1998).</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"18\" ssid=\"7\">Multi-source methods combine lexical cohesion with other indicators of topic shift such as cue phrases, prosodic features, reference, syntax and lexical attraction (Beeferman et al., 1997a) using decision trees (Miike et al., 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Litman and Passonneau, 1995) and probabilistic models (Beeferman et al., 1997b; Hajime et al., 1998; Reynar, 1998).</S>\\n',\n",

       " '    <S sid=\"22\" ssid=\"2\">A tokenizer (Grefenstette and Tapanainen, 1994) and a sentence boundary disambiguation algorithm (Palmer and Hearst, 1994; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) or EAGLE (Reynar et al., 1997) may be used to convert a plain text document into the acceptable input format.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"23\" ssid=\"3\">Punctuation and uninformative words are removed from each sentence using a simple regular expression pattern matcher and a stopword list.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"24\" ssid=\"4\">A stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980) is then applied to the remaining tokens to obtain the word stems.</S>\\n',\n",

       " '    <S sid=\"28\" ssid=\"8\">The similarity between a pair of sentences :1:, y For short text segments, the absolute value of sim(x, y) is unreliable.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"29\" ssid=\"9\">An additional occurrence of a common word (reflected in the numerator) causes a disproportionate increase in sim(x, y) unless the denominator (related to segment length) is large.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"30\" ssid=\"10\">Thus, in the context of text segmentation where a segment has typically &lt; 100 informative tokens, one can only use the metric to estimate the order of similarity between sentences, e.g. a is more similar to b than c. Furthermore, language usage varies throughout a document.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"31\" ssid=\"11\">For instance, the introduction section of a document is less cohesive than a section which is about a particular topic.</S>\\n',\n",
       " '    <S sid=\"32\" ssid=\"12\">Consequently, it is inappropriate to directly compare the similarity values from different regions of the similarity matrix.</S>\\n',\n",
